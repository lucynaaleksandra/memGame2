MEMORY GAME

This is a simple memory game built to test user's memory. 
There are 14 cards (6 sets being displayed). The game is over when all cards are matched. 
The user can start the game over using a "Play Again" button. 
The game shuffles the cards with each new game, reveals the cards for a second before flipping them all to the back of the card. 

BUGS 
The mechanics of this game are not perfect. If the card is clicked on too fast, the game might freeze. 
Taking a moment after the card is fully revealed is advised for smoother performance. 

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
There can be time clock added, as well as number of moves updating with each click.
